# CardGame
Project is a simplified recreation of the former video game: Card-Jitsu. 

## Rules: 
- Each player has a deck of card jitsu cards. Each card has a "element", number and color. 
- Each round, each player compares the card at the top of their respective decks. 
- Depending on the element and number drawn, a winner is chosen. 
- THe first player to have 3 cards of the same element and different colors or 3 cards of different elements and different colors is declared the winner. 

This project automatically plays games against itself following the rules of the original game. Outcome of each round will be shown and the final winner will be shown. 
In the future, I hope to introduce more complexity to the types of cards and hope to create an interface for people to play the game.
